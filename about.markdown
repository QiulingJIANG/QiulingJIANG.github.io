## Hi there 👋

Welcome to my digital hoarding space 🐹

This blog is essentially my attempt at becoming a *productive* hamster. You know how hamsters stuff everything into their cheeks for later? Well, I stuff knowledge, notes, and random thoughts into this blog. The difference is that I actually plan to come back and use them (hopefully).

### What's this blog about? 🎯

With the generous help of AI (because let's be honest, I wouldn't have figured out half of this setup on my own), I created this little corner of the internet with a few humble goals:

- **Build a writing habit** — because "I'll remember it later" has never worked
- **Read more, forget less** — turning reading into actual learning
- **Document the journey** — from computational electrochemistry to whatever rabbit hole I fall into next

Think of it as my brain's external hard drive, open-sourced for anyone who might find it useful — or at least mildly entertaining.

### About Me 🤔

Just someone who loves 🐱 but is too scared to actually adopt one.
